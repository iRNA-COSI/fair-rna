# The FAIR RNA Manifesto

Too many tools to choose from? Help us promote our guidelines for collaboratively developing fewer, better and FAIRer tools in RNA bioinformatics!

## About

Advances in experimental methodologies used in RNA research have led to an explosion in data volumes and corresponding analysis tools and workflows alike, with dozens of tools being available for tasks such as single cell sequencing analysis or the estimation of transcript expression from RNA-Seq data. Apart from the sheer number of tools, the way in which academic research is conducted, with severe time constraints and a quick turnover of personnel that rarely consists of trained developers, severely exacerbates the situation: code bases are not maintained, badly documented, untested and/or not made publicly available. Consequently, end users find it difficult to decide which tool to use and new tools have a hard time penetrating a crowded market. We propose to challenge this situation by compiling a set of guidelines that aims to concentrate resources on the development of fewer, higher-quality tools.

The manifesto outlined here encourages
- tool/workflow developers to collaborate early and publicly, follow Open Source Community standards such as FAIR and 4OSS, and adopt available community standards/best practices in terms of API design, used file formats, testing, documentation and continuous integration/delivery
- developers to contribute to external/available Open Source Software projects
- end users to choose tools that comply with these recommendations and demand their adoption
